# Polysilicon Market Set to Surge to USD 41,502.20 million by 2034 | FMI Study

With an initial forecast of USD 15,819.00 million in 2024, the sales revenue of polysilicon market is vouching a considerable rise to USD 41,502.20 million by 2034. After a thorough survey, the polysilicon market sales reflect an upward trajectory from 2024 to 2034, inferring a healthy growth rate of 9.90%.

The augmentation in polysilicon adoption from the solar power segment escalates the poly-Si market growth. The surging demand for polysilicon for myriad commercial uses, comprising manufacturing of multi-crystalline solar panels and others, and the innovation and expansion of diverse end-use industries in emerging economies directly influence the polycrystalline silicon market’s growth rate.

Due to price inconsistency, the dearth of raw material demand and supply is a roadblock to the polycrystalline silicon market expansion. The expensive research and development, the government’s strong rules on commercial operations, proliferating export and import taxes, and strict international trade sanctions inhibit the market growth of polycrystalline silicon. High capital investments hamper the potential of poly-Si market expansion.

Competitive Landscape

The market is somewhat fragmented and presents favorable circumstances to major polysilicon manufacturers and startups, but high investment expenditures curb entry to small or novel poly-Si vendors. Polysilicon producers emphasize strengthening their production ability across diverse regions to satisfy spurring demand from developing countries with significant production.

Noteworthy Developments

Daqo New Energy Corp., a polysilicon producer based in China, commenced its pilot production at a novel factory in December 2021. The production plant was anticipated to produce 35,000 tonnes of polysilicon per year initially and then slowly rise to 105,000 tonnes yearly.
In May 2021, REC Silicon ASA, a polysilicon and silicon gas supplier headquartered in Norway, announced the restart of its Lake Moses Plant in Washington in 2023. Earlier the plant was shut down in May 2019 over the imposition of tariffs by China on polysilicon manufactured by the United States.
