# Polyisocyanurate Insulation Market to Surpass USD 24,325.3 million by 2035

From 2025 to 2035, the market share is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5%. The market sales of polyisocyanurate insulation for polyisocyanurate insulation are expected to reach a valuation of USD 24,325.3 million by 2035 and are expected to surpass USD 15,612.3 million in 2025.

The insulation industry is observing a rise in customization and prefabrication, which enables manufacturers to customize insulation products to match project specifications precisely. Prefabricated polyisocyanurate insulation components are becoming more widely available because they have the benefits of easier building procedures, lower labor costs, and more effective installation. Manufacturers who provide these customization choices are better positioned to stand out in this crowded market and cater to the particular requirements of specific projects.

Increased extreme weather events are driving the demand for building-resilient insulating materials. In response, producers of polyisocyanurate insulation are creating goods that provide better defense against environmental problems, including temperature swings and moisture intrusion. These solutions position producers as suppliers of dependable, weather-resistant insulating materials while improving structures’ safety and longevity.
