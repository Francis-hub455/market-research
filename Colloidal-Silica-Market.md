Colloidal Silica Market Reaching USD 342.3 Million by 2030 | FMI

The global colloidal silica industry demand was valued at USD 252.0 million in 2022 and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 3.9% during the forecast period (2022-2030).

Colloidal silica is finding immense use in the electronics & semiconductor industry, wherein it plays a critical role in the production of ultra-flat, uniform, and low-detection surfaces for semiconductors.

Moreover, colloidal silica is used as a rough surface remover and as a polishing additive. It is extensively used for electropolishing to remove microscopic layers of metal particles from surfaces.

In addition, the growing electronics & semiconductor industry in South and East Asia is expected to drive the colloidal silica market over the decade ahead. Paints & coatings and paper & pulp industries are also expected to pave the way for market growth in the coming years.

A significant portion of the revenue of the colloidal silica market is realized from the electronics & semiconductors industry. However, this industry is likely to witness a decline in the near term due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is spreading across the world. The onset of the pandemic has resulted in travel bans and isolations, uncertainties in the stock market, and massive disruption of the supply chain. As such, the pandemic would adversely impact the global electronics & semiconductor industry and, in turn, hamper the growth of the global colloidal silica market.
